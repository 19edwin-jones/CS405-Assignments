# CS-405: Secure Coding – Portfolio

This branch (`portfolio`) serves as a **clean, curated submission** of my final deliverables for **CS-405: Secure Coding** at Southern New Hampshire University. It exists as an orphan branch, separate from the `main` branch where all iterative work, commits, and version control were tracked during the course.

The materials in this portfolio reflect applied secure programming practices using C++, following SEI CERT C/C++ standards and secure development lifecycle strategies.
